Introduction
-----------------------------

MongoAlchemy is a layer on top of the `Python` `MongoDB` driver which adds 
client-side schema definitions, an easier to work with and programmatic query 
language, and a Document-Object mapper which allows python objects to be saved 
and loaded into the database in a type-safe way.

An explicit goal of this project is to be able to perform as many operations 
as possible without having to perform a load/save cycle since doing so is both
significantly slower and more likely to cause data loss.

There's more detail in the :doc:`tutorial`, but a small example is on 
this page below the contents of the documentation.


Installation

Examples
------------------------------

    >>> from mongoalchemy.session import Session
    >>> from mongoalchemy.document import Document, Index, DocumentField
    >>> from mongoalchemy.fields import *
    >>> # Subclasses of Document both provide the mapping needed for 
    ... # queries as well as the classes for loading/saving objects.
    ... class User(Document):
    ...     config_collection_name = 'users'
    ...     
    ...     # Setting the possible values by using fields
    ...     first_name = StringField()
    ...     last_name = StringField()
    ...     age = IntField(min_value=0, required=False)
    ...     
    ...     # db_field allows a different DB field name than the one on the 
    ...     # python object
    ...     email = StringField(db_field='email_address') 
    ...     bio = StringField(max_length=1000, required=False)
    ...     
    ...     # A computed field decorator allows values
    ...     @computed_field(SetField(StringField()), deps=[bio])
    ...     def keywords(obj):
    ...         return set(obj.get('bio','').split(' '))
    ...     
    ...     kw_index = Index().ascending('keywords')
    ...     name_index = Index().descending('first_name').ascending('last_name')
    ...     email_index = Index().descending('email').unique()
    ...     
    ...     def __eq__(self, other):
    ...         return self.email == other.email
    ...     
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return 'User(email="%s")' % self.email
    ... 
    >>> me = User(first_name='Jeff', last_name='Jenkins', email='jeff@qcircles.net', 
    ...     bio='Jeff is the author of MongoAlchemy')
    >>> 
    >>> me.keywords
    set(['author', 'of', 'is', 'Jeff', 'MongoAlchemy', 'the'])
    >>> 
    >>> # This connections to the DB and starts the session
    ... session = Session.connect('mongoalchemy-intro')
    >>> session.clear_collection(User) # clear previous runs of this code!
    >>> 
    >>> # Insert on a session will infer the correct collection and push the object
    ... # into the database
    ... session.insert(me)
    >>> set(['author', 'of', 'is', 'Jeff', 'MongoAlchemy', 'the'])
    >>> 
    >>> # Get a user with me's email address and MongoAlchemy in their bio (via keywords)
    ... db_user = session.query(User).filter(User.email == 'jeff@qcircles.net').in_(User.keywords, 'MongoAlchemy').one()
    >>> 
    >>> db_user == me
    True
    >>> 
    >>> # Using filter_by for simple equality checking is easier
    ... session.query(User).filter_by(email='jeff@qcircles.net').in_(User.keywords, 'MongoAlchemy').one()
    User(email="jeff@qcircles.net")
    >>> 
    >>> # It's also possible to do raw mongo filtering
    ... session.query(User).filter({'email':'jeff@qcircles.net', 'keywords':{'$in':['MongoAlchemy']}}).one()
    User(email="jeff@qcircles.net")
    >>>
