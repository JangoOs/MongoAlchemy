======================

See: http://mongoalchemy.org/

This project is in maintenance mode. I'm accepting pull requests and fixing minor bugs, but you should not expect any significant new features or rearchitecting. I'm not writing any python that uses mongo these days, so I'm not keeping up with all of the most recent changes.

With the exeption of a few issues the project is in pretty good shape and should be usable for many purposes. The most glaring issue right now is that updates and subdocuments really don't play nice together.

I'm also happy to give the ability to commit to people who submit a lot of good pull requests.
